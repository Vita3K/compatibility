- CPU backend:              <!-- As of today Vita3K uses two CPU backend engines to run games: Unicorn and Dynarmic.
                            When testing games Dynarmic should be prefered as it normally gives better results than Unicorn.
                            You can change the CPU backend on the emu settings -->
- Renderer backend:              <!-- As of today Vita3K uses two renderer backend engines to run games: OpenGL and Vulkan.
                                 When testing games OpenGL or Vulkan, sometimes OpenGL/Vulkan is better to know the issue.
